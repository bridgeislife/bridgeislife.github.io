new bridge website



## Running Instructions
If you run this site locally (by clicking on index.html), you will get CORS errors. 
To avoid this, it needs to be run in a webserver. Either push changes directly to github and have 
them deployed, or run a local webserver. 

### Local Python Server
To run a local webserver in python, first go to the directory of the site, then run:

    python3 -m http.server
