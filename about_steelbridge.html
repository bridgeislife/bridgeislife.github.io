                The Architectural Engineering Institute (AEI) is a subsidiary of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

                They list their mission as "To promote an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach to planning, design, construction and operation [...] by encouraging innovation, collaboration and excellence in practice, education and research of architectural engineering."
            </div>
            <div class="para" id="p1.3">
                AEI was founded in 1998, and has inspired clubs at numerous colleges and universities throughout the United States.

            <div class="para" id="p1.4">
                At Drexel University, AEI is a professional organization which aims to give students with an interest in architecture and construction a group of peers with whom to create personal and professional relationships. Activities range from social events such as bonfires to professional events such as resume reviews, and site tours. 
            </div>
            <div class="para" id="p1.5">
                A large part of AEI at Drexel is the Steel Bridge Team. The focus on the design and construction of a bridge strong enough to withstand 2500 pounds of vertical load is a perfect intersection of almost all the values in the AEI mission statement.
