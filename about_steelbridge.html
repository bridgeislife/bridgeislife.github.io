            <div class="para" id="p2.1">
                The Steel Bridge Team is one of the longest standing competitive teams at Drexel University. The purpose of Steel Bridge is simple: design, fabricate, and build (timed) a bridge out of magnetic steel which is able to withstand 2500 pounds of vertical load and 50 pounds of lateral load within provided deflection bounds. 
            </div>
            <div class="para" id="p2.2">
                The team participates in the annual American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) collegiate competition regionally, and has advanced to the national stage of competition in 4 out of the last 5 years. Most recently, the team competed in Carbondale, IL where we placed first in the nation for lightest bridge. Though being a lightweight is not generally rewarded, in this case it meant the least excess material required for withstanding the loads put on the bridge in competition. 
            </div>
            <div class="para" id="p2.3">
                Each year the team spends most of Fall term generating designs for the bridge, and Winter term fabricating. When Spring term rolls around, we try to be finished fabrication so that our builders can practice timed construction leading up to the regional competition which usually takes place early in Spring term. 
            </div>
            <div class="para" id="p2.4">
                The team is an incredible way to build lasting friendships, as well as learn real engineering skills (ie. CAD drafting, testing in STAAD software, fabricating, welding, and team time management) in a setting that's different from a traditional classroom. 
            </div>
            <div class="para" id="p2.5">
                Meetings for fall term of the 2019-2020 school year will be held on Monday evenings. If those times don't work for you but you're interested, don't be a stranger! Contact us and we'll figure out how you can get involved outside of usual meeting times.
